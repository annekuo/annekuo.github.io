                <h3>How might we make the order flow easier to use?</h3>
                <p class="twelvepx">Airpals is a B2B courier service startup based in New York City, aiming to solve the problem of expensive internal logistics across the city. Their website provides a clear and streamlined ordering process and order tracking dashboard for business professionals. Our team of five UX researchers conducted 11 moderated remote user tests on the order flow of the Airpals desktop website. We aim to identify existing usability problems and recommend potential fixes.</p>
                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <p class="twelvepx">
                    In this study, our whole team had equal shares on recruiting, testing, analyzing, presenting, and reporting. I moderated three user testing sessions and took notes for two, corresponded with our client and our instructor, set up zoom meetings, wrote the 3rd recommendation as well as the executive summary in our final report. As I have previous experiences with graphic design, I took the responsibility of styling the slides and report, converting our digital grouping table into Figma, as well as collecting the illustrations that fits the the overall style.

                <h2>Understanding our clients</h2>
                <p class="twelvepx">We met the Airpals team via zoom to discuss their expectation and pain points. In the meeting, they explained that the order flow is the core function of their website. They are confident about their design, but they are curious about why people often leave the pick up and drop off notes blank, even though there are alerts reminding the users. They also want to know if their order completion interface matches users’ expectations. Concluding their expectations, we decided to focus on three questions:</p>
                <h3>Evaluation Focus</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is the general experience of the order flow?</li>
                    <li>Why do users skip pass pick up and drop off notes?</li>
                    <li>What do users naturally do/expect after completing the order?</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Testing Plan</h2>
                <div class="block">
                    <h4>Scenario</h4>
                    <p class="twelvepx">Just like you have used delivery services before, you will be using Airpals today to send a package to me at the Pratt Institute Manhattan campus (144 W 14th St, New York, NY 10011) from work. Think about the last thing you had to deliver or something that you deliver frequently and what items you were sending.</p>
                    <h4>Task</h4>
                    <p class="twelvepx">Your task will be to locate and complete the form to send a package to me with delivery on the next business day. Remember to think about the last package you sent or one that you’ve sent before when filling out the form details.</p>
                    <h4>Post-Test Questions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>[If they skipped the item description/pick-up/ drop-off] Why did you decide to leave the description/pick-up/drop-off notes field(s) blank?</li>
                        <li>What would you typically do next after submitting your order?</li>
                        <li>Is there anything else you would like to say about your experience with the form?</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <h3>Pilot Test</h3>
                <p class="twelvepx">We ran five pilot tests to ensure our script and tasks works smoothly and generates proper feedback. Several adjustments were made after we review our pilot tests:</p>
                <ol class="twelvepx">
                    <li>We eliminated the second task — asking users to describe their expectations of the confirmation email, and answer if the email matches their expectation. This task was too brief that participants had to answer post-task questions all over again within a minute. Instead, we decided to verbally ask users about when they would do next after they submitted their order.</li>
                    <li>We fixed some of the dummy information that did not pass the validation.</li>
                    <li>As logging in is required to complete the order form, we decided to provide an Airpals account for the participants, so that they wouldn’t need to user their own credentials for the test.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Recruitment & Participant Demographic</h3>
                <p>With the personae, audience industry and audience job role provided by Airpals, we were able to define our target demographics. We sent out a screening form and contacted people that meets the following criteria:</p>
                <ul class="twelvepx">
                    <li>They have previously used courier services</li>
                    <li>Their work is based in New York City</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We conducted 11 user testing and retained 8 that best fit our target demographic. Participants range in age, gender, industry, job title, and company size. </p>

                    We conducted the user testing via Zoom with one moderator and one note-taker in each session. Testing notes were recorded with a Google form and later converted into Google sheets for further analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the digital grouping method to analyze our findings. Problems and observations were listed out, labeled with problem type, and grouped by page of occurrence. Pages that has the most problems were prioritized and synthesized into recommendations, whereas smaller but recurring problems are placed in a list of other adjustments.

                <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                <h3>#1 Streamline the Flow for Inputting Parcel Details</h3>
                <p class="twelvepx">The current "How" page asks for three kinds of information: item details, sender and recipient, and pick-up and drop-off notes. Participants wished therer were clearer instructions about parcel size, and a more obvious value field. We also observed that participants failed to enter item handling instructions in the given field.</p>
                <p class="twelvepx">Therefore, we recommend adding max. dimensions of shipment sizes, a $ sign before the value field, and a separate item handling instructions field. We also suggest moving the pick-up and drop-off notes to the "What" page so it would not be confused with handling instructions.</p>

                <h3 class="twentyfourtp">#2 Clarify Pick-up & Drop-off Instructions</h3>
                <p class="twelvepx">
                    Following the previous recommendation, we discovered that people skip through the pick-up and drop-off notes not only because it was a exhaustive page, but also the placeholder text was very long. Moreover, the pop-up asks for both pick-up and drop-off notes even when participants included one of the two. Participants also expect to see recipient and sender information alongside their address.
                </p>
                <p class="twelvepx">
                    In this situation, we recommend simplifying the placeholder text, and labeling the field with plain language (e.g. How should we access the pick-up location?) In addition, the popup alert should specify which fields users left blank. Lastly, adding sender and recipient in the address section would make it more complete.

                <h3 class="twentyfourtp">#3 Improve Flexibility and Consistency for Time Selection</h3>
                <p class="twelvepx">
                    In the time selection page, limited "delivery by" options are offered, and the default time is set at 8PM, which is past opening hours. On the other hand, the pickup window dropdowns gave little visual cue that it can be edited. It also seems that each field opens one dropdown, when in reality it opens three separate dropdowns. 
                </p>
                <p class="twelvepx">
                    Using a dropdown for the "deliver by" time would offer more flexibility for seleciton, and setting the default time at 6PM, a common office closing time, would ensure that the package is delivered on the designated day. On the other hand, aligning the dropdown style to text fields would also act as a stronger signifier so that users know this field can be edited. The time selection field is also redesigned so that each field opens up one dropdown, which would be closer to user expectations.

                    In our user testing, 2 out of 8 particiapnts attempted to edit specific parts of their orders only to be brought back to the very start of the form. 
                </p>
                <p class="twelvepx">
                    As the "Edit" button appears in every row, bringing users back to the specific section would better match the common practice and user expectations.

                    3 out of 8 participants did not notice the error messages displayed right beneath the fields. In longer pages, participants also had trouble finding the error since the problematic field is scrolled away from the visible area.
                </p>
                <p class="twelvepx">
                    We recommend making the error field more visible by using heavier font weight and changing the field color to red. Upon glancing, the red area would be easily spotted. Adding a error message beside the "Continue" button to list out the problematic fields would also act as a signifier reminding users which field name they should look for.

                <p class="twelvepx">
                    Without selecting from the dropdown, the address field automatically clears all the data entered. If users press "tab" to switch to the next field without selecting, the field will be automatically filled with an adress that has nothing to do with the entered data. Moreover, address fields cannot be directly edited after selecting from the dropdown. Users have to click on the "X" to clear the field, then enter a new address. 
                </p>
                <p class="twelvepx">
                    We recommed keeping the entered data intact while displaying the error message if users click away without selecting. Enabling users to directly edit an selected address would also be more efficient. This way, users can easily edit the address fields without typing everything all over again.

                <h4>"I want to express my sincere gratitude for all the hard work and dedication you put into this project. Your contributions will be of tremendous help, and we're excited to implement your feedback."<br>— Joshe, CEO and Founder of Airpals</h4>
                <p>The Airpals team gave us positive feedback about our study. They were even using "wow" reactions during the Zoom meeting while we pointed out things that they never noticed before. Joshe was kind enough to invite us to check back in 6 months and see what they have implemented.</p>  
              <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <h3>Align Client Expectation with Our Plan</h3>
                <p class="twelvepx">Often times clients may not understand what a usability test consists, and <span class="highlight">it is important to explain the methodology and what might be out of scope that would not generate natural feedback.</span> Our clients initially pictured having a product demo, observe how participants go through the website, and ask for their feedback. We explained that having people that made the website involved in the testing could affect participant’s feedback, and testing without introducing too much would be a better way to observe natural behaviors. We are very grateful that our clients decided to trust us and conduct the test as we planned, and without the firm explanation, this would not have happened. </p>
                <h3>Test Every Material Externally to Avoid Bias</h3>
                <p class="twelvepx">We scrutinized and tested the testing script to make sure it is error-free, but did not thought about applying the same spirit to the other testing materials. Turns out that the screening question <span class="highlight">“Have you ever send things for work” can be interpreted into sending virtual objects like email or digital files</span>, while we actually wanted to know if people had experience with courier services. In the end, we had to eliminate three user testing sessions from the results since these participants did not have experience sending physical objects. This reminds me the importance of double checking every material with people outside of the group to avoid collective blind spots.</p>
