                This project was conducted during my job at PT. ICE Messenger Indonesia, which is an instant-messaging app startup. Our product manager decided to incorporate a street food map in our app so that users would have more content to engage with. The challenge was to decide upon a product scope that includes all the core functions, but also producible in 5 months. As my first B to C project, I was also challenged to make an interface catered towards Indonesians.

            <h4>User Interview</h4>
            <p>
                We started out with user interviews to qualify our scope. Specifically, we want to know how people get to know about street foods around them, how they navigate to the location or get it delivered. From our interview with 4 Indonesians ranging from 25 - 42 years old, we concluded the following observations:

            <p>From these observations, we decided that incorporating the navigation system into our map would be far-reaching in such a short period of time. Thus, we decided to focus on the discovery and sharing aspects of our street food map.

            <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
            <p>Since discovery and sharing is related to geographical information and social interactions, I mapped out popular apps for food discovery, food delivery, maps, travel guides, and social media.

            <p>We decided to place our street food map in the top right close to the origin— our app will offer more social interactions than pure food delivery and searching applications like Yelp and Perikulinger, and we won’t dive too deep on providing every category of geological information and navigation functions like Google Maps. We were able to summarize our direction with this HMW statement:

            <p>With the time constraint and the scale of the team we had, it is important to prioritize the functions that is needed the most. I also recorded common functions relevant to geographical information and social interactions and sorted them by importance.

            <p>We started with a few basic sketches, mapped out the user flow, then developed it to a full prototype for usability testing. Based on those feedback, we made some design iterations:

                <p class="big-numbers">01</p>

            </div>
                <p>The biggest usability problem we discovered is that people figure out how they can open the location in Apple Maps or Google Maps. Since the button was hidden three layers deep and signified with an icon, most of our participants failed to find where it lies in. Therefore, we decided to replace the cover photo with a mini map. Users can click the mini map to open it in their default map applications. We also add a navigate icon in the header, which is also another way to open the map.

                <p>When I was sketching out the first wireframes, I was mostly referencing American applications like Google Maps and Yelp, and I thought Indonesian Apps won’t be too different. Turns out there’s a whole different style in South East Asian Apps: the use of colorful Icons is prevalent in apps like Grab, ShopeeFood, and GoFood. Therefore, we worked with an Indonesian graphic designer to illustrate icons for us.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <p>The biggest thing I learned in this project is to <span>be humble and curious in front of a foreign culture.</span> At first, I assumed that since Indonesians use Google Maps a lot, their own apps won’t look too much different than American ones. Through user interviews and competitive research in the right direction, I was introduced to a whole different Interface style. I was stunned by how these apps can incorporate many vibrant colors, but still appear to be clean, friendly, and usable. I was taught that minimal design is the standard practice, but I learned from this project that this might not apply to every culture — and designs that are rich with colors can be equally friendly to users too. In future projects, I would think of this experience and remind myself to be humble and curious towards cultures and fields that I am not familiar with.
            </p>
            <h4>If I Had More Time...</h4>
            <p>I would probably add a <span>street food tracking feature</span> to the app. Since some of the street food are sold in little stands or carts, they would move around in nearby areas just like ice cream trucks. It would be cool if there is a way to report and track where the street food currently is. It might be possible if one day there is enough users and cooperating food stands!
